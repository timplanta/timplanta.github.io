Education
======
* BSc (First Honor) in Biological Science & Mathematics. The University of Hong Kong. (2020-24)
* Visiting students. Yale University. (2022-23)

Employment experience
======
* Sep. 2024 - (now). Research Assistant (II)
  * [GEARS Lab](https://wu-jin.weebly.com/), School of Biological Science, the University of Hong Kong
  * Supervisor: [Dr Jin Wu](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/wu-jin).
  * **Project 1. Community level estimation of aboveground biomass based on feature extracted from TLS point cloud and random forest regression.**
    * Will be published soon.
  * **Project 2. Optimal sampling strategy for mapping global aboveground biomass dynamics using Bayesian Hierarchical Model.**
    * Bayesian hierarchical model can bring more information than the normal linear regression models, especially in terms of the local creditability and local distribution information while providing an accurate mean estimation.
    * Current sampling strategies used to map a certain forest/plant trait globally is biased, by that the sampling site concentrate around human habitats. Unfortunately, we do not know how biased it is with traditional modeling methods.
    * Part 1. Confirming the optimal sample strategy around the world so that the credibility of the global map would be optimal.
    * Part 2. Use the conclusion of Part 1 to build global AGB map, then analyze its dynamic under different climate change scenario.
    
* Feb. 2024 - Jun. 2024. Student Research Assistant
  * [Wang Lab](https://wanglaboratory.mystrikingly.com/?lang=EN), School of Biological Science, the University of Hong Kong
  * Supervisor: [Dr Peng Wang](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/wang-peng).
  * Final year project. See below for details.

Research experiences
======
* Sep. 2023 - Jun. 2024. Final Year Project
  * [Wang Lab](https://wanglaboratory.mystrikingly.com/?lang=EN), School of Biological Science, the University of Hong Kong
  * Supervisor: [Dr Peng Wang](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/wang-peng).
  * Working primarily on the interaction between chlorophyll synthesis pathway and translation and focus especially on interaction between proteins cpSRP54 and another ribosome protein, uL4.
  * Built the *ul4* mutant using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) to prevent lethal phenotype, and discovered a highly defected chlorophyll synthesis in such mutant.
  * Found and further confirmed the strong linkage between the chlorophyll biosynthesis regulate genes and ribosome docking on the thylakoid membrane, as well as that the ribosome docking on thylakoid membrane is triggered by light.

* Dec. 2022 - Aug. 2023. Undergraduate researcher.
  * [Gendron Lab](https://gendronlab.yale.edu/) at Department of Molecular, Cellular and Development Biology, Yale University.
  * Supervisor: [Prof Josh Gendron](https://mcdb.yale.edu/people/joshua-gendron).
  * Working on a new project of computationally analyze the mechanisms of Arabidopsis (metabolic daylength measurement system)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580721005992]. Modeling the system using a linear time-invariant model.
 
* Jan. 2022 - Aug. 2022. Summer Research Fellowship.
  * Supervisorï¼š Dr. Clive Lo.
  * Help in the current project of enzyme regulations in the tricin biosynthetic pathways. Taking care of plants (including sorghum and rice).
 
* Jun. 2021 - Aug. 2021. Summer Research Fellowship.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wallace Lim.
  * Work on the topic of using biosensors to monitor in planta regulation of pyruvate in plant cell under light. Helped in transforming the pyruvate detecting florescent sensor into the Arabidopsis.
