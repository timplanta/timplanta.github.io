Hello there! I am Tim Sui, a current research assistant at (the School of Biological Sciences, HKU)[https://www.biosch.hku.hk/]. Please see my CV (here)[https://timplanta.github.io/cv/]. 

I am super interested in both math and biology, and I am typically interested in solving biological problems using mathematical and statistical methods. Specifically, I wish to apply mathematical and computational tools into the plant physiology and ecophysiology study, where modeling methods are not widely applied, while traditional methods are insufficient for problem-solving. Some field of biology and mathematics that I am interested in is listed below.
*	**Plant physiology**: Plant circadian oscillators and photoperiodism, how metabolism and physiological signal regulating growth and development in plants interplay.
*	**Dynamical systems**: Applied dynamical systems in biology. Oscillators. Stochastic dynamical systems and oscillation. Hamiltonian systems.
*	**Applied statistics**: Applied statistical learning in forestry and in genomic research.

I will constantly upload some interesting thoughts here. As a math lover, I have also made a series of notes as well as resources for self-studiers like me. They can be fetched (here)[https://timplanta.github.io/publications/].
